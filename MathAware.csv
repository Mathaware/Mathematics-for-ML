This is how I felt when I first encountered the concept of Federated Learning. It's a realm where AI blooms through collaboration without the need to expose the individual essence of each data flower. At its core, Federated Learning is about harnessing the collective power of data while safeguarding privacy, a principle increasingly crucial in our digital age.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Diving deeper, I discovered that Federated Learning is not just a protective measure but a revolutionary approach to building intelligent systems. It enables devices to learn from each other, sharing insights, not data. This method keeps sensitive information securely on the device, only exchanging learning outcomes.
